Sorting Algorithms 

-> Bubble Sort ----> O(n^2)

-> Selection Sort ---> O(n^2)

-> Insertion Sort ---> O(n^2)

-> Merge Sort ---> O(nlogn)

-> Quick Sort ---> O(n^2)


Searching Algorithms

-> Binary Search/ Bisection ---> O(logn)

-> Hash map search ---> O(1)



Linked List -> O(n)
Stacks (LIFO - Last In First Out)
Queues (FIFO - First In First Out)

Access -> O(n)
Search -> O(n)
Insert -> n(1)
Delete -> n(1)
since we are tracking the tail/head else the insert/ delete would have been O(n)
